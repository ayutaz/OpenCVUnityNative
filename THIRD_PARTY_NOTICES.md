# Third-party notices

This file documents the third-party components bundled inside the OpenCV
5.0.0 build that this package links against — **not** this repository's own
source, which is Apache-2.0 (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)).

- OpenCV version: **5.0.0**
- Build configuration hash: **6ba270f342e3** (`tools/opencv-config.psd1`,
  see `tools/OpenCvConfig.psm1` for how the hash is derived)
- Source of the texts below: the actual files under
  `third_party/opencv/6ba270f342e3/etc/licenses/` in the restored artifact
  (`./tools/opencv.ps1 restore`), not summarized from memory.
- Confirmed present in the binary: `third_party/opencv/6ba270f342e3/x64/vc17/staticlib/`
  contains `zlib.lib`, `libpng.lib`, `libjpeg-turbo.lib`, `libclapack.lib`
  alongside the `opencv_*.lib` module libraries. `tools/verify-opencv-artifact.ps1`
  enforces that no other third-party library sneaks into this list (see its
  `$PermittedThirdPartyLibs` allowlist).

If the config hash above changes (a new OpenCV build), re-derive this file
from the new artifact's `etc/licenses/` directory — do not assume the set of
bundled libraries or their license text is unchanged.

## libjpeg-turbo

License: dual — the IJG License (for the libjpeg API) and the Modified
(3-clause) BSD License (for the TurboJPEG API and build system)
(`third_party/opencv/6ba270f342e3/etc/licenses/libjpeg-turbo-LICENSE.md`)

```
libjpeg-turbo Licenses
======================

libjpeg-turbo is covered by two compatible BSD-style open source licenses:

- The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed in
  README.ijg (reproduced below in this file, under "IJG License").

  This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs,
  including any code inherited from libjpeg and any modifications to that
  code.  Note that the libjpeg-turbo SIMD source code bears the
  zlib License (https://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib), but in the context of
  the overall libjpeg API library, the terms of the zlib License are subsumed
  by the terms of the IJG License.

- The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed below

  This license applies to the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs, as
  well as the build system.  Note that the TurboJPEG API library wraps the
  libjpeg API library, so in the context of the overall TurboJPEG API library,
  both the terms of the IJG License and the terms of the Modified (3-clause)
  BSD License apply.


Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses
==========================================

This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the
best of our understanding.  This is not a license in and of itself.  It is
intended solely for clarification.

1.  If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source,
    then:

    1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices
        from the source.

        Origin: Clause 1 of the IJG License / Clause 1 of the Modified BSD
        License / Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License

    2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source
        file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file.

        Origin: Clause 1 of the IJG License / Clause 2 of the zlib License

    3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the
        copyright or license text in that file.

        Origin: Clause 1 of the IJG License

2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or
    if you are distributing an application that statically links with
    libjpeg-turbo, then:

    1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:

        This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG
        Group.

        Origin: Clause 2 of the IJG license

    2.  If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then
        your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD
        License (see below.)

        Origin: Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License

3.  You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the
    contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.

    Origin: IJG License / Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License

4.  The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be
    free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable
    consequences resulting from your use of the software.

    Origin: IJG License / Modified BSD License / zlib License
